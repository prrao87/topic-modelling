# New York Times Articles
This repository uses the New York Times news dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/nzalake52/new-york-times-articles). 

First, download the `.txt` file from the Kaggle link. The data is a raw text dump and requires some preprocessing to organize into a structured form, which is shown in the notebook `preprocessing.ipynb`.
